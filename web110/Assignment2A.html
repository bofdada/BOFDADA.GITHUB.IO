    <p>Assignment 2A- Summary<br>
        Session2- Internet Fundamentals/Web Browser<br>
        Activity 1- Browser settings installation <br>
        In this activity, I went to settings then Privacy and security, then site settings then select the site, finally it showed that it has changed. I installed google chrome browser. Earlier, I was using Microsoft edge browser.
Some of my key learnings are as follows:
1.I found google chrome is faster than Microsoft edge browser.
2. I can personalize my browsing more effectively and I feel it is more secure in terms of data security due to chrome's built in protection against phishing and malware. I can control cookies, enable or disable pop-ups, tracking protection etc.
3.I can limit advertisements whichever I don’t need.
4.After signing in my google account, I can synchronize settings across devices.
        In this activity I will be able to apply in my current or future environment, as in today`s world cyber security is very important. I can apply this knowledge on my personal computer and office computer. Especially, it has given me more alertness and technical knowledge which I can apply for future financial transactions.<br>
      

  Activity 2- How to check my internet speed<br> 
        In this activity, I learnt about checking the speed of the internet.
        1.To check the internet speed, we can find a variety of websites learnt specifically about speed test website.
        2 I learnt about upload speed and download speed concept and the difference between the two.
      3.I learnt that 10mbph is good speed for video streaming etc. But we can always opt for a better speed.
4.I learnt some ways to improve my speed. First is, I can restart my computer and modem.
5.I can close some applications and programs which I am not using.
6.I can also try ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi.
        In this activity I will be able to apply in my current or future environment by trying to increase the speed of my internet at home and in the office. I don’t need to call an IT person to check my internet speed in the office. Also, whenever I am travelling, I can check my internet speed.
