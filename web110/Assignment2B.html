    <p>Assignment 2- Summary<br>
        Session 2- Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines<br>
        Activity 1- Google search <br>
        In this activity, I learnt the process of google search.
Some of my key learnings are as follows:
1.When we try to search something on google, we think we are searching on web, but actually we get our required information through google database (called as index).
2.This search activity is facilitated by a software program(spider).
3.When we search for something based on the words given by us, spiders start connecting to the webpages, then they follow the link of other relevant pages, thus it is chain of pages.
4.The quality of google search can be assessed by the algorithm based on the words displayed in the title along with adjacent words including synonyms. It also analyzes based on the credibility factors of the website in terms of spam, page factor etc.
        In this activity I will be able to apply in my current or future environment, as literature review is one of my areas of studies. I can apply this knowledge for getting relevant information for writing a research paper. Especially, it has given me more awareness about suing specific words to bring in more accurate results. <br>
      

  Activity 2- Search Engine optimization <br> 
        In this activity, I learnt the concept of search engine optimization which is about specific and fast search of data.
        1.It uses the algorithm by using specific key words like titles, headings, and content given by the user.
        2 I learnt about searching for file by type (doc, pdf), date ( before 1996),
       3.I learnt that images can be searched by size or color
       4.I learnt some websites are shown first by these search engines based on factors like fast loading times, easy navigation, and mobile adaptability.
        In this activity I will be able to apply in my current or future environment by trying to use advance google search for my future essay writings for studies. This will save my valuable time.
