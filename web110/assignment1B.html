2. History of the Internet
The Internet emerged as a final product of continuous efforts of scientists to connect data networks since the early 20th century. In 1960s, U.S. Department of Defense built ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). ARPANET was a flagship project that connected a few universities and research institutions on the base of research information sharing. The current internet was created in the 1980s because of the invention of protocols like TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which made it possible for various networks to link to one another. Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1991. With the help of web browsers and hyperlinked documents, the system improved internet accessibility and usability. The common man became familiar with the internet in the early 1990s when web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator were introduced.
